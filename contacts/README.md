The goal is to facilitate efficient contact management while ensuring secure user authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
  - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive design.
  
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
  - Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user and contact information.
  - Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
  - bcryptjs: A library to hash passwords for secure storage.
  - jsonwebtoken: A library to generate and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
